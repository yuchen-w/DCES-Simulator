Following a number of supervisor meetings with Dr Pitt, a number of work items have been identified. A Gantt Chart was created to facilitate the planning and tracking of the project progress. A copy of the current Gantt Chart can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:GanttChart}. The Gantt Chart was a continuous working document which will be update as the project progresses. Tasks were added as new ideas for the project became available.

Throughout the year, the Gantt Chart was updated to reflect changing priorities, targets and difficulties as the projects progressed. The final project Gantt Chart can be seen below:
