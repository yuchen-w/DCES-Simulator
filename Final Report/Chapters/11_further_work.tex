So far, the works carried out will be only be applicable for one community in rural Rwanda. It is hoped that work will be carried out to make this applicable to other communities by including more generation types such as biogas, and more types of appliances owned by each house.

In addition, the e.quinox Micro Grid is currently undergoing feasibility studies. If time allows, a system could be designed and built for the Micro Grid to allow the trading of electricity between households to guarantee electricity supply for when it is needed. This system however will have a completely different set of requirements, which will be drawn up after the completion of this project.
