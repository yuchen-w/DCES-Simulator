Since October, an attempt has been made on understanding the properties of Common Pool Resource, and how electricity can be a Common Pool Resource in the context of a Decentralised Community Energy System. An attempt has been made on building a simulator of a Decentralised Community Energy System in developing countries. 

The simulator demonstrated that the 

The simulation of the Decentralised Community Energy System will be used to explore possible utilisation patterns within rural communities, and also explore controls for regulating the use of electricity. If the study proves to be successful, an attempt at designing and implementing a trading platform for Decentralised Community Energy Systems will be made.
