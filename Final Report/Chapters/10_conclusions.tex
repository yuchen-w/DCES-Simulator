\label{Conclusions}

Since October, an attempt has been made on understanding the properties of Common Pool Resource, and how electricity can be a Common Pool Resource in the context of a Decentralised Community Energy System. An attempt has been made on building a simulator of a Decentralised Community Energy System in developing countries. 

The simulator being built has the ability to self-organise and fairly allocate electricity to end-users.

This Simulator of a Decentralised Community Energy System can be further developed with more features to explore possible utilisation patterns within rural communities, and also explore controls for regulating the use of electricity.
