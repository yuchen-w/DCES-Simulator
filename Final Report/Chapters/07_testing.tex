\label{Testing}

The final product of this project should be a realistic simulation of a Decentralised Community Energy System. To produce the simulation, each of the following features will be tested to ensure they work individually and together:

\begin{itemize}
\item A network of Agents able to trade electricity with each other.
\item Agents are able to utilise energy. The amount of energy utilised can be pre-determined manually by an operator of the simulation or automatically with an algorithm.
\item Agents are able to generate an amount of energy corresponding to a pre-allocated fixed output, or an amount based on their assigned Generation Profiles.
\item Each Agent is able to utilise and generate electricity at the same time.
\end{itemize}
%If data is available for the potential customers in Rugaragara, the simulation could be used in %conjunction with the feasibility study
