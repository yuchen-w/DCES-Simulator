\chapter{Introduction}
\label{introduction}

In many areas of rural developing countries, there are often no wide-spread access to a continuous and reliable electricity supply such provided by the country's electricity grid \cite{IEA-web:2015}. However there exists many isolated sources of electricity generation such as solar panels and standalone diesel generators utilised by relatively wealthy households, shops and buildings belonging to large organisations. 

The aim of this project is to explore the idea of using a holonic institution to model a Decentralised Community Energy System which bring together the existing decentralised generation infrastructure to provide an affordable source of reliable electricity for users in rural communities. 

Over the course of this project, a multi-agent simulation model was built using Presage2 with individual households and businesses modelled agents. The agents can be grouped together to form communities such as villages, which in turn can be grouped together to form a larger entity such as a district or a province. 

%To do: cite here:
With humans being social creatures who are likely to band together to form communities, the structure of the decentralised energy system model will be designed in a similar way with holonics. The structure of how the simulation is designed is based on the design of holonic systems. In the case of this project, the simulation will be to distribute fairly electrical power between interrelated agents which are in turn composed of interrelated subagents recursively, until reaching lowest level of subagents (households and businesses). 

To allow the model to be realistic, candidate rural communities with no access to a source of reliable electricity will be identified using data and research. Additional data on usage habits and potential generation profiles of generators in the candidate areas will be obtained through research to produce a simulation model that is accurate and relevant.
