\label{Requirements}

It is therefore required that the simulation platform will have the following features:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Multiple Forms of Generation: Renewable and Non-renewable generators which can operate continuously or discontinuously
  \item Realistic Generator Models: Programmable variable generation power output to simulate wind and solar power
  \item Multiple demand centres: the simulation will be of one or more communities operating with a number of households/businesses requiring electricity
  \item Self organising by the system to appropriate the available power fairly to all users
\end{itemize}

As this is a simulation to be implemented in Presage2, there are no specific requirements which must be adhered to with regards to speed, portability and performance.  

The simulation is to be developed using Presage2. It is hoped that a network of Decentralised Community Energy Systems can be simulated, and a working trading system can also be developed for the trading of limited available energy within communities towards the end of the project time frame.
