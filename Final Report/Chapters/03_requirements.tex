\label{Requirements}
In this project, a model of a rural electricity network that is disconnected to the grid is expected to be modeled. The network will be holonic in structure and will consist of communities of "smart households" which will generate and utilise electricity depending on their demand and generation profiles. Therefore the simulation is required to have the following features:
\begin{itemize}
  \item Multiple Forms of Generation: Renewable and Non-renewable generators which can operate continuously or discontinuously
  \item Realistic Generator Models: Programmable variable generation power output to simulate wind and solar power
  \item Multiple demand centres: the simulation will be of one or more communities operating with a number of households/businesses requiring electricity
  \item Self organising by the system to appropriate the available power fairly to all users
  \item Presage 2: The simulation will be programmed in Java using Presage 2.
\end{itemize}

As this is a simulation to be implemented in Presage 2, there are no specific requirements which must be adhered to with regards to speed, portability and performance.  

The simulation was developed using Presage 2, with the hope that a network of Decentralised Community Energy Systems can be simulated, and an algorithm for fairly appropriating available generation to demand will be implemented.
