Decentralised CES: This contains all of the source code for my final year project. Import this into Eclipse or IntelliJ as a Maven project. Follow the steps here: https://github.com/yuchen-w/FYP/blob/master/Decentralised%20CES/README.md

## Project stuff
To do: 
- Create multiple agents (done)
- Create environment (done)
- Make the Environment talk to the Agents (done)
- Make the Agents contribute to the Pool (done)
