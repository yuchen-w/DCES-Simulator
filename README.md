# FYP
Repository for my EE4 FYP. Forked from the publicly available FYP-repository-test (https://github.com/yuchen-w/FYP-repository-test)

## To do: 
- Create multiple agents (done)
- Create environment (done)
- Make the Environment talk to the Agents (done)
- Make the Agents contribute to the Pool (done)
- Make the Agents take from the Environment Pool (done)
- Tidy up the code and publish! (done)

## Next Steps:
- Explore nesting of agents
  - Explore creating agentservice
- Store data
- Integrate JBoss Rules Engine (http://www.jboss.org/drools/)

## Notes:
- Extending the use of EnvironmentService can't be used with injecting @Step . Something more fundamental in the source code is required.
